## Idea
 implementation of embedding steering, utilizing features like per-memory norm calibration and LLM-assisted context generation.The goal of embedding steering is to force the model to interpret a specific input token (like the entity name "Mickey") not as its default pre-trained meaning, but as the custom memory vector we created.

 We can then reduce the total amount of text in the context window needed to describe something, and also boost the influence of that token downstream.

 This method can also potentially be used to create the 'Golden Gate Claude' where the model contextualizes everything reltative to some concept.  A way to create a 'mood' or artificial emotional state.

 Additionally, it could be used in jailbreak situations if 'explain' or 'allow' or specific tokens that steer the model towards compliance even though it is returning tokens from a space not aligned with safety training.  jailbreak isn't really the focus, but effective jailbreak would mean the concept in general is a powerful way to override base training and a potential 'short cut' around fine tuning in some cases.
